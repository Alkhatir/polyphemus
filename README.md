# polyphemus

To run the code, clone the repository and install the required packages in requirements.txt.

## Generation
Run the following command to generate music:

```python
python generate.py
```

With polyphemus, you can specify what instruments should be played at specific timesteps. You can do this by editing the structure.json file. This file contains a list of 1s and 0s for each track and bar. Each of such lists has length `n_timesteps`. When setting values in a list to 1 or 0, the model will play or silence the corresponding track at the specified bar and timestep. The number of lists for each bar must be equal to the number of tracks the model was trained on. The number of bars in the track activation file, instead, can be smaller than `n_bars`, which is the number of bars generated by the model for each sequence. In this case, the partial binary structure will be copied to reach `n_bars`. In this way, it is possible to e.g. compile the binary activations for just one bar and let the model use this same structure for each bar.
